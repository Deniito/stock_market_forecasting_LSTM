This repository contains an LSTM-based deep learning model designed to predict a company's stock price using historical financial data. The model combines the following sources:

- **Numerical Data from SEC Financial Reports**: Key financial metrics from 10Q and 10K SEC filings.
- **Stock Market Data**: Historical stock price movements.
- **Technical Indicators**: Indicators such as Moving Averages (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and others to capture market trends.

By processing this data through a LSTM network, the model learns temporal dependencies and complex patterns in the financial and market data, generating predictions for stock prices 90 days ahead.
